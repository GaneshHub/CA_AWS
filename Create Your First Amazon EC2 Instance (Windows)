Creating a Windows EC2 Instance:
=================================
Introduction
In this Lab Step, you will use the AWS Management Console to create an EC2 instance running Windows. EC2 instances are virtual machines within AWS that can be used for a multitude of purposes, including hosting web applications, server-side logic and more.

Instructions
1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter EC2, and click the EC2 result under Services:
2. From the EC2 dashboard, click Launch instances:

Note: If you encounter the new launch experience, click Opt-out to the old experience at the top of the page to ensure a consistent experience for this lab:

3. In the search box, enter windows and select the Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base AMI:

4. On the Choose an Instance Type page, ensure t2.micro is selected and click Review and Launch:

5. On the Review Instance Launch page, click Launch:
6. In the Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair dialog box, select Create a new key pair, enter testkey in the Key pair name field, and click Download Key Pair:

7. Click Launch Instances:

A confirmation page will let you know that your instance is launching:

8. Click View Instances to close the confirmation page and return to the console:
On the Instances screen, you can view the status of your instance. It will take a short time for your instance to be launched. When you launch an instance, its initial state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running (if not, try to refresh the EC2 instance page).

 Retrieving the Administrator Password Using the Keypair:
 ========================================================
 Introduction
Amazon EC2 uses public–key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public–key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair. To log in to your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect to the instance. 

By default, most Linux instances have no password and you use a keypair to log in using SSH. Windows instances have an auto-generated Administrator password that you can retrieve using the keypair file.

 Instructions
1. Navigate to instances in the EC2 console.

 2. Right click on the instance you launched, select Security, and click Security -> Get Windows Password:
 Warning: The EC2 instance must be initialized before you can get the windows password, if you see a message like the following, wait a minute or two and try again:

 When ready you will see a form asking you to enter the keypair you generated in the previous lab step.

 3. In the Get Windows password form, click Browse, browse to the private key file (.pem) that you previously downloaded and click Open:

 4. Click Decrypt Password:
 You will see the Private IP, User name, and Password:

 5. Make a note of the password that is displayed, you will use it later in the lab.

 

6. To return to the EC2 Instances list page, click Close.
Summary
In this Lab Step, you used the AWS Management Console to fetch a password using an EC2 Key Pair.

Connecting to a Windows EC2 Instance Using a Remote Desktop Connection:
=========================================================================
Introduction
You can connect to a server running Windows from another computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft.

Remote Desktop clients exist for all versions of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and OS X operating systems.

In this Lab Step you will connect to your Windows EC2 instance using Remote Desktop Connection.
Instructions
1. In the list of EC2 instances, select your instance:
2. To open the Connect to instance form, click Actions and then click Connect:
3. Click the RDP client tab:
. To download a file containing the remote desktop connection details, click Download remote desktop file:
Your browser will download the file.
3. To launch Remote Desktop Connection from Windows 7, navigate to the Accessories group on your local computer and click the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. To launch Remote Desktop Connection from Windows 8 or greater, press the Windows key to access the Start screen, type the word "remote" and then click the Remote Desktop Connection search result. If you are using MacOS, you first need to download the Remote Desktop app 
4. Once Remote Desktop Connection opens, click Show Options:
5. In the Connection Settings box that appears, click Open to open your File Explorer. Select the Remote Desktop Protocol file you downloaded to automatically populate the Computer and User name fields:
6. Click Connect:
7. Click Connect on the Unknown Publisher dialogue box that appears:
8. Enter the password you saved into the Password field of the box that follows and click Ok:
9. In the following dialogue box, ignore the warning and click Yes:
Within a moment a window will open containing a view of a Windows desktop.

In this Lab Step, you used Remote Desktop Connection to connect to a Windows EC2 instance via RDP.

Viewing the EC2 instance metadata (Windows):
============================================
Introduction 
Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance(hostname, instance ID and type, public and private IP address and the availability zone). In this Lab Step, you will view metadata for your instance by navigating to an AWS node that is only available from the instance itself. 
Instructions
1. In your Windows EC2 instance, through your Remote Desktop Connection, click alt at the bottom of the screen to open Internet Explorer.
2. In the dialogue box that follows click Ask me later:
3. In the default tab that opens, paste http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ into the address bar and press Enter.
4. Note the list of phrases that appear on the page that follows:
Each phrase is a route that you can append to the end of the url you entered in the url bar.

 5. To test this, copy hostname from the list of routes and append it to the url you entered earlier. Press Enter.
 In this Lab Step, you used an AWS-specific route from within your Windows EC2 instance to view metadata on that EC2 instance.
