Enter the following credentials created just for your lab session, and click Sign in:

Creating an IAM User Group:
==========================

Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

Warning: Because of our strict policy, you have to use the same names provided in the lab for each resource that needs to be created (group, users, etc.).
 From the IAM dashboard, click on User groups link in the sidebar menu:

Note: You will see errors indicating your student user does not have permissions to perform specific actions:
This is expected and just means that your permissions are limited to the scope of this lab.

Click on the Create Group blue button for creating a new IAM group:
In the User group name field, enter DevOps as the name of the group:
Skip down to the Attach permissions policies section, enter AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess into the search bar and select the resulting policy: AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess:
Click Create Group. 

The Groups page now lists the new group and you are able to assign the DevOps group to any available user:

Creating an IAM User:
========================
Instructions
1. From the Identity & Access Management console, click on Users in the sidebar menu:
2. Click Add users to begin creating a new user:
Note: You can create up to 10 users at a time with usernames that don't exceed 64 characters.

 3. Enter the following values in the form:

User name: John (Name must be case sensitive)
Access key - Programmatic access: Checked
Password - AWS Management Console access: Checked
Console password: Autogenerated password
Require password reset: Unchecked

4. Click Next: Permissions to advance to the next step.

 5. Click Next: Tags. Skip this page and click on Next: Review.
 6. Click Create User.
7. Click Download .csv for downloading a CSV file containing the security credentials and then click Close:
8. Review the newly-created user in the IAM Console:
You will now add John to the DevOps Group.

9. Click User groups > DevOps to open the DevOps group details view:
10. Click Add Users.
11. Check John and click Add Users:
Observe that John is now in the DevOps group:

Logging in using the new IAM credentials:
=========================================
After you have created IAM users and created passwords for them, users can sign in to the AWS Management Console by using a special URL, which has this format: https://AWS-account-ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console. In this lab step, you will get the opportunity to use a similar log-in link to log in to the newly-created IAM User.
Instructions
1. From the Identity & Access Management console, click on Users in the sidebar menu.

2. Click John on the IAM User page:

3. Click Security Credentials and then navigate to the Console sign-in link listed in the tab:
4. Use the credentials in the CSV file you downloaded to log in as John.
5. From the AWS Management Console, click on Services at the top of the page and type S3 into the text box. Select the S3 option:
6. Notice that due to the restrictive permissions you placed on the IAM user "John", you receive an Access Denied message when attempting to access S3 resources:
